# COGS-137-Project

The COGS 137 course was an introduction to the capabilities of R and the utility it carries in the world of data science and statistics. In our final project my group decided to take a fun approach on analyzing what specific factors help predict a higher rating of a Scooby-Doo episode/movie. To do this, we utilized a forward selection process on a linear regression model to observe the highest adjusted R2 value given a certain combination of factors. We ended up doing the forward selection by hand, but in the future I look to define a function to carry out this forward selection process so that more factors can be included in the analysis.
